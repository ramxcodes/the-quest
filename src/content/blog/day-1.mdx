# Day 1 - Starting Strong

Today was a fantastic blend of brain and brawn! I tackled some challenging DSA problems, made progress on my job work, and wrapped up an energizing workout. Here’s a detailed look at my routine:

## DSA Challenges

I spent the morning solving 5 DSA problems. One of my favorite challenges was the **Two Sum** problem. Below is my JavaScript solution which uses a hash map for optimal performance:

```js
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return [];
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

This approach helped me understand how leveraging data structures can significantly improve algorithm efficiency.

## Job Work Highlights

After the coding session, I switched gears to focus on my professional tasks. Here’s what I accomplished at work today:

- **Bug Fixes:** Resolved several issues that were affecting our production environment.
- **Performance Optimization:** Improved the response times of our APIs.
- **Team Collaboration:** Joined a strategic meeting that laid out the week’s priorities and action items.

These efforts not only sharpened my problem-solving skills but also helped me earn an extra ₹1000 through performance bonuses.

## Workout Routine

Balancing mental work with physical activity is key to staying productive. Here’s a snapshot of my workout session:

- **Warm-Up:** 10 minutes of dynamic stretching and light cardio.
- **Strength Training:** 
  - 3 sets of push-ups
  - 3 sets of squats
  - 3 sets of lunges
- **Cardio:** 20 minutes of brisk running.
- **Cool Down:** 5 minutes of stretching and mindfulness meditation.

Staying active is essential to keep my energy levels high and to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
